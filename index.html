<p># About</p>

<p>
I am a Ph.D. candidate at University of Amsterdam. My advisor is Dr. Efstratios Gavves. I also received supervision from Dr. Thomas Mensink and Prof. Arnold Smeulders. Since 2020 I have been working closely with Dr. Basura Fernando (A*STAR, Singapore) and Dr. Hakan Bilen (University of Edinburgh).
I work on 3D computer vision and deep learning.
</p>
<p>
I obtained my M.Sc. (cum laude) in artificial intelligence from Utrecht University. My thesis research was conducted at CWI Amsterdam, advised by Dr. Eric Pauwels. I hold a B.Sc. in physics at Fudan University.

# Research Interest
</p>

<p>
I am interested in deep learning and computer vision in general. 
</p>
<p>
More specifically, my PhD research focuses on 3D deep learning, including recognition or reconstruction of various types of data such as 2.5D RGB-D semantic segmentation and point cloud learning.
Currently I am working on 3D reconstruction and 3D generative models with neural implicit 3D representations, in particular how implicit functions can generalise to a shared representation for a variety of shapes. Another direction I am working on is the intersection of graph neural networks and 3D vision.
</p>
<p>
In addition, I have been also involved in the projects with collaborators and master students on the topics covering transfer learning, self-supervised learning, few-shot learning, image filtering and multi-spectral satellite images.
